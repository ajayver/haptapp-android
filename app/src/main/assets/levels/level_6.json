You follow behind him and before you know it, someone squeezes your nipple and runs away!  \n\n“That’s our Mean Monkey! It never wastes a chance to squeeze someone's nipple.” \n\nMeanwhile the Mean Monkey was running and jumping around with a mean face. \n\nYou and your guide go back to the Tiger’s Treasure room, then to the Okay room and outside of the palace. \n\n“Let’s see how well did you learn?”",
