  "desc": "“This is going to be the last set of rooms in the palace”, says your guide while entering the spacious white Okay room and heading towards the right door. You follow him and enter the Tiger’s Treasure room. You then turn right again and enter the Mean Monkey room with crossed hands on your chest just in case.\n“Let’s go to the left first!”\nAs you open the left door, you feel something crunchy below your feet. You look down and notice that the floor is covered with thousands of gemstones! You look around and you see a spacious garden filled with glittering gemstones. Seems like this garden has stones of every imaginable size, color, and shape lying everywhere – along the water springs and on the trees, even the birds’ nests are built of gemstones!\n“This is the Gem Garden room! Shiny, isn’t’ it?” notices the energy ball. \nThe gemstones continue to crunch under your feet as you walk towards the door to the left.\nWhen you open it, you see a Zebra standing in the middle, but it’s not a normal Zebra. Unlike others, this one’s stripes are not straight, but have a Zig-Zag shape. \n“Meet the Zig Zag Zebra!” proudly presented the ball, while the Zebra didn’t look interested in any of you and continued to chew some grass ignoring your presence.\nYou walk back to the Gem Garden and move through it towards the right door.\nWhen you enter it, you see a Quintillion Quadcopters flying all around with loud buzzing noise. Sometimes you can feel the wind made by their blades, when a Quadcopter flies nearby. The Quadcopters are dancing together, orchestrated by something as if they were a single body taking different random shapes.\n“The Quintillion Quadcopters room is the last one in this direction. Let’s head back to the Mean Monkey room”, shouted the guy to make sure he is heard behind the noise of all the copters.\n\n“Okay, only one room left! Let’s get back to the Mean Monkey room,” says the guide while floating back into the Gem Garden.\nYou follow him through the garden and back to the Mean Monkey room. You walk across the room trying not to step on the Monkey and enter the last room in this palace. The room has a dome shape inside with a rectangular hole at the top. A gigantic telescope in the middle of the dome is pointing towards the night sky full of stars. It is quiet, calm and mildly dark here. You can see a couple of scientists taking turns looking at the telescope while arguing about some numbers on a white board.\n“Welcome to the Observatory, the final destination in the palace,” happily stated the guide and flew away in a wide spiral motion around the dome toward the top. \n“The final room of the palace!” he shouted coming back. \n“Congratulations, my friend, you’ve made it to the end, but let’s not forget our game and practice the new room before your final exam!”\n",
