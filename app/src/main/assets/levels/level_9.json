  "desc": "You and your guide are back in the Ice Igloo room. \n“There are two doors from here, let’s firs go to the left one,” says the energy ball and head toward the left door. \nWhen you enter the room, you feel sweet minty scent of massage oils, accompanied with quiet murmuring of water and relaxing music. \n\"This is the Snake Spa room,\" says the guide. \nYou notice several massage tables with snakes laying on them while being twisted and squeezed in every imaginable way by professional massagers. Most of the snakes blissfully smile with their eyes closed. Apparently, they are enjoying the massage.\nGoing through the left door from here, you enter a room and immediately hear a loud “Hiccup! Hiccup!” sounds. The room smells like a farm barn and in the middle of it, you see a huge hamster. \n“Hiccup!”\n“Meet the Hiccupping Hamster! Somebody should give him a glass a of water.” said the guide turning around. \n“Let’s get back through the Snake Spa room to see what’s behind the other door.\nYou both quietly pass by relaxed snakes covered with hot stones, until you reach the other door. \nThis room is dark, wand you can hear a loud noise like there is a small jet airplane taking off! As your eyes get used to the darkness of the room, you see a vampire, diligently vacuuming the floor with a satisfied smile.\n\"He hates dust,\" briefly noted the guide. \"We call this the Vacuuming Vampire room\".\nLet’s practice the new rooms!",
