  "desc": "You and your guide go back to the Ice Igloo room. “There are two doors from here, let’s firs go to the left one,” said the energy ball and head toward the left door. When you enter the room, you feel a sweet minty scent of massage oils, accompanied with quiet murmuring of water and relaxing music. \"This is the Snake Spa room,\" said the guide. You notice several massage tables with snakes laying on them while being twisted and squeezed in every imaginable way by professional massagers. Most of the snakes blissfully smile with their eyes closed. Apparently, they are enjoying the massage.\nGoing to in the left door from here, you enter a room and hear a loud “Hiccup! Hiccup!” sounds. The room smells like a farm bars and in the middle of it, you see a huge hamster. “Hiccup!” \n“This is the Hiccuping Hamster room,” said the guide turning around. “let’s get back through the Snake Spa room to see what’s behind the other door.\nYou both quietly pass by relaxed snakes cover with hot stones, until you reach the other door. This room is dark, wand you can hear a loud noise like an airplane is taking off! As your eyes get used to the darkness of the room, you see a vampire, diligently vacuuming the floor with a satisfied smile.\n\"He hates dust,\" briefly noted the guide. \"We call this room Vacuuming Vampire\".\nLet’s practice the new rooms!\n",
