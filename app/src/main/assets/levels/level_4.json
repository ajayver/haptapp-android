  "desc": "Once you have learned about the first three rooms of the palace, you probably noticed that each of them has a unique \"rhythm\" of vibrations. The ultimate goal of this course is to make you memorize the patterns of many rooms with the least possible effort. Later on, we will shorten the room names down to letters and we will have a whole alphabet of rhythms. This process takes some time and efforts, but it will give you the essential intuition behind reading text from haptic and other digital feedback. By using the memory palace technique, we shorten down the learning time from weeks down to days, or even hours.\nIf you feel overwhelmed by all the new rooms, take a break, give your brain a night to get familiar with the rooms you already learned before moving to the new ones.\n",
