  "desc": "Great!\n\nIt seems like you've got a good grasp on the game's mechanics! Let's talk about terminology. Haptapp is an unary communication method, meaning that it is a language with only one letter/signal. And because there is only one kind of signal, its name doesn't really matter. Let's call it \"1\" for now. We will also refer to each signal as \"tap\".",
