  "desc": "Going to the right from the freezing Ice Igloo room, you enter a bright sunny room with grass on the floor and bird chirping. In the middle of the room, you see a magnificent white unicorn weirdly holding an umbrella with his front hoof. There is no rain, but the unicorn seems to be confident and proud. \n\"Welcome to the Unicorn with Umbrella room!\" Introduced the guide. “There is nothing to the right from here, but there is one last room on the left”.\nYou enter the room to the left, and you see a dense field of weirdly moving tiny flowers. Each petal of the flowers shines with bright orange color and waves slowly like a flame pointing up. It even feels hot in this room!\n\"The Flame Flower room! Congratulations, my curious friend, this is the last room in the left side of the palace! You are now familiar with every room to the left from the Okay room!\"\n",
